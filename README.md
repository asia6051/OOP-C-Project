# OOP-C-Project
The project consisted of designing an object from real-life based on object-oriented programming. It was necessary to include all object-oriented programming paradigms in it. My project represents a schematic of an animal clinic, which employs staff, accepts patients (along with their assigned caretakers) for visits, during which prescriptions can be issued, etc.
